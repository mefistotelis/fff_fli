I have written this tool to decode FLI files
from a game Syndicate Wars (Bullfrog 1996).
The files had modified format, so I coudn't
read them in FLI player.

This program fixes all headers, but animation data
is not changed.
It means that after using this tool,
there is still a chanse that file has errors.

No warranty (bla bla bla)

I will distribute this tool with source.
Ideas? (I dot't think anyone is intrested in fixing old FLIcs):
